# IFD Week 4: `LeafletJS`

### **[LeafletJS](https://leafletjs.com/)** an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps.

##

### **MAP TILES**

![Map Tiles](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/03/Tiled_web_map_Stevage.png/300px-Tiled_web_map_Stevage.png)

Mapping on the internet is generally displayed in the form of dozens of seamless **[tiles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiled_web_map)**. There are several map tile providers available to the public, but some require *API Keys* in order to display tiles on your site.

Fortunately, there are several tile sources that are free to use. Thanks to [Alex Urquhart](https://github.com/alexurquhart), there's a useful tool to help find the best **[Free Tile Service](http://alexurquhart.github.io/free-tiles/)** for your next project! Not only can you find basemaps, but he provides a method of viewing overlays simultaneously. Another example is [BBBike Map Compare](https://mc.bbbike.org/mc/).

Images are served through a web server (*some examples below*), with a URL like `http:// ... /Z/X/Y.png`, where **Z** is the *zoom* level, and **X** and **Y** identify the *tiles*.

### **ATTRIBUTION**

Whichever map tile provider you decide to use, proper **Attribution** is *mandatory*! If you are using multiple map tile providers, you must supply proper attribution for each layer. Some examples of attribution are below, but be sure to double-check for updated attribution details per vendor.

##### *example of multiple map tile attributions*
![Attribution Example](example-project/img/attribution.png)

*NOTE*: Some map tile providers are starting to embed attribution automatically. By default, *Leaflet* attribution is built-in, and with certain plugins like the *Esri Geosearch control*.

| Map Provider | Example *Attribution* |
| --- | --- |
| **[ArcGIS - Esri](https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/attribution/)** | *Powered by Esri* |
| **[Bing maps](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/maps/mobile-brand-guidelines)** | *© Microsoft Corporation Earthstar Geographics SIO* |
| **[CARTO](https://carto.com/attribution/)** | *© CARTO* |
| **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/permissions/geoguidelines/attr-guide/)** | *Map data © Google* |
| **[HERE](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/examples/here-maps.html)** | *Map Tiles © HERE* |
| **[OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright)** | *© OpenStreetMap contributors* |

### **COORDINATES**

If you aren't using a dataset with pre-determined latitude/longitude coordinates, then the easiest way to find coordinates is to use **[Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps)**. Find a specific place, *right-click* and select `What's here?`. It'll bring a pop-up at the bottom of the page with details about where you've clicked, along with the coordinates.

![Example Coordinates on Google Maps](example-project/img/latlng.png)

You can copy/paste from the pop-up, or click directly on the link to get the coordinates larger on screen. Be careful copying any coordinates from the pop-up at the bottom, and remove any blank spaces that may have accidentally been copied from Google.

##

### **BASIC MAP**

Believe it or not, you can have your own map with as little as a few lines of code!
For demo purposes, I'm going to use the **World Street Map** provided by *ArcGIS | Esri*. This example uses the LeafletJS CDN for version 1.4.0 which is the current version at the time of this build (April 2019).

**HTML**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.4.0/dist/leaflet.css" type="text/css">
<div id="map"></div>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/leaflet@1.4.0/dist/leaflet.js"></script>
```

**CSS**
```css
#map {
    height: 500px;
}
```

**JS**
```js
let mapTileLayers = L.tileLayer("http://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/World_Street_Map/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}", {
    attribution: "Powered by <a href='https://developers.arcgis.com/terms/attribution/' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>Esri</a>"
});

let map = L.map("map", {
    layers: [mapTileLayers],
    center: [23.5, 12],
    zoom: 2
});
```

Et voila! That's it! You've got a simple map of Earth!

##

### **MAP OVERLAY**

If adding a map **overlay**, it must come *after* the map settings above in your JavaScript file.

**JS**
```js
let mapOverlay = L.tileLayer("http://services.arcgisonline.com/arcgis/rest/services/Reference/World_Boundaries_and_Places/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}");
mapOverlay.bringToFront().addTo(map).setZIndex(9);
```

Note that it's setting `.bringToFront()` and `.setZIndex(9)` so it sits on top of the basemap layer.

##

### **MARKERS**

You can add a simple **marker** with the following code:

**JS**
```js
let myMarker = L.marker([-22.951993, -43.210439]).addTo(map);
```

That will add a basic marker on *Christ the Redeemer* in Rio de Janeiro.

If you'd like to add a few additional items to the marker for user-interaction, just append them to the same line, immediately after `.addTo(map)`

- `.bindPopup("Christ the Redeemer")`
    - pop-up with text once clicked
- `.bindTooltip("Rio de Janeiro")`
    - tooltip with text on hover
- `.openPopup()`
    - sets the pop-up to be automatically opened when the map loads

##

### **CUSTOM MARKERS**

You can have the marker be whatever image you'd like with a few extra lines of code!

**JS**
```js
let rioIcon = new L.Icon({
    iconUrl: "img/rio.png",
    iconSize: [50, 50],
    iconAnchor: [25, 50]
});
rioMarker.setIcon(rioIcon);
```

| &lt; code &gt; | meaning
| --- | --- |
| `iconUrl:` | image location in your directory |
| `iconSize` | image size (width: 50px; height: 50px;) |
| `iconAnchor` | sets location of marker respective to LatLng coordinates [X, Y] |
| `rioMarker.setIcon(rioIcon)` | append custom icon to marker |

##

### **CIRCLES**

Drawing a **circle** radius on your map is simple, with a few optional properties listed below.

**JS**
```js
let myCircle = L.circle([53.349807, -6.260255], {
        color: "#000",
        opacity: 0.5,
        fillColor: "#0f0",
        fillOpacity: 0.5,
        radius: 50
    }).addTo(map).bindPopup("Dublin Spire").bindTooltip("Dublin");
```

| &lt; code &gt; | meaning
| --- | --- |
| `let myCircle = L.circle([53.349807, -6.260255], {` | LatLng of circle (Dublin Spire) |
| `color` | stroke color |
| `opacity` | opacity from 0-1 |
| `fillColor` | fill color |
| `fillOpacity` | fill opacity |
| `radius` | radius of circle |
| `}).addTo(map).bindPopup("Dublin Spire").bindTooltip("Dublin");` | append with pop-up and tooltip |

##

### **POLYLINES**

A **polyline** is a straight line from one coordinate to another.

Note: It will not bend or arc as it would normally do on a sphere. Actual physical straight line on screen.

**JS**
```js
let myPolyline = L.polyline([
    [-22.951993, -43.210439],
    [40.676698, 117.241585]
], {
    color: "red",
    weight: 5,
    opacity: 1
}).addTo(map).bindPopup("<b>Christ the Redeemer<br>- to -<br>Great Wall of China</b>").bindTooltip("Rio to Beijing");
```

| &lt; code &gt; | meaning
| --- | --- |
| `[-22.951993, -43.210439],` | starting coordinates of polyline (Rio) |
| `[40.676698, 117.241585]` | ending coordinates of polyline (Beijing) |
| `color: "red",` | color can be a 'name', #HEX, RGB(A), etc. |
| `weight: 5,` | stroke or width of line |
| `opacity: 1` | opacity of line |

##

### **POLYGONS**

**Polygons** are multi-sided shapes that take several coordinates to render. Each LatLng combo represents a new point on our shape.

My sincere apologies to the Kazakh nation for this crappy rendition of their wonderful country, which I had the pleasure of visiting in 2017!

**JS**
```js
let kazakhPoly = L.polygon([
    [41.791686, 52.532313],
    [44.613073, 50.300030],
    [45.962637, 53.090383],
    [47.042953, 52.462554],
    [46.228697, 49.567562],
    [49.276056, 46.533053],
    [51.780782, 51.032498],
    [51.216236, 59.717473],
    [54.072007, 61.356805],
    [55.321612, 70.425454],
    [53.869636, 73.317153],
    [54.304194, 76.736554],
    [50.953315, 79.947535],
    [50.986721, 83.119436],
    [49.184949, 87.481489],
    [47.220813, 85.740977],
    [47.220813, 83.005456],
    [45.330319, 82.264586],
    [45.008892, 79.871005],
    [42.283878, 80.191691],
    [43.272062, 74.235027],
    [40.716621, 68.437327],
    [43.655295, 65.110162],
    [43.564289, 61.955585],
    [45.597759, 58.496693],
    [45.046214, 56.011634],
    [41.321885, 55.497063],
    [42.403493, 54.075143]
]).addTo(map).bindPopup("Kazakhstan").bindTooltip("Kazakhstan");
```

##

### **ON MAP CLICK**

You can also create a function that will display the actual latitude and longitude where the user clicks on the map. The example below gives a fixed decimal value of 5 digits maximum.

**JS**
```js
let popupClick = L.popup();
function onMapClick(e) {
    popupClick
        .setLatLng(e.latlng)
        .setContent("latitude: <b>" + e.latlng.lat.toFixed(5)
        + "</b><br>longitude: <b>" + e.latlng.lng.toFixed(5)
        + "</b>").openOn(map);
}
map.on('click', onMapClick);
```

##

### **PLUGINS**

LeafletJS has dozens of compatible plugings built by several people around the world. The majority of plugins for Leaflet can be found on their [Plugins Page](https://leafletjs.com/plugins.html). For the most part, documentation is fairly straightforward and simple enough to incorporate into your map projects.

One such example is the **Esri Geocoding control** which allows a user to search for practically any location on Earth. Full documentation can be found [here](http://esri.github.io/esri-leaflet/examples/geocoding-control.html). The simplest way to implement this into your map is to add the following:

*NOTE: This is for Esri Geocoder version 2.2.13 at time of demo (April 2019)*

**HTML**
```html
<!-- add the Esri CDN links for CSS and JavaScript-->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet-geocoder@2.2.13/dist/esri-leaflet-geocoder.css" type="text/css">
<script src="https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet@2.2.4/dist/esri-leaflet.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/esri-leaflet-geocoder@2.2.13/dist/esri-leaflet-geocoder.js"></script>
```

**JS**
```js
let searchControl = L.esri.Geocoding.geosearch().addTo(map);
```

However, all that does is bring you to the destination searched. You can take it a step further and display a marker.

**JS**
```js
let results = L.layerGroup().addTo(map);
searchControl.on("results", function (data) {
    results.clearLayers();
    for (let i = data.results.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        results.addLayer(L.marker(data.results[i].latlng)
        .bindPopup(data.results[0].text)
        .bindTooltip(data.results[0].text));
    }
});
```

**BUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!**

Unfortunately, I find that the Geocoder control isn't too helpful when searching more than one location. For example, if you were to search for **Vinita, Oklahoma** (*former site of the [world's largest McDonald's](https://www.mcdonalds.com/us/en-us/location/ok/vinita/will-rogers-turnpike/10319.html)*), and then immediately search for **Dublin, Ireland**, the search control will not find Dublin.

**WHY NOT?**

Once you get to a certain zoom-level, the Geocoder will only filter results that are visible on the user's current screen, or within a certain proximity.

**A FIX** : built by [Tim Nelson](https://github.com/TravelTimN)

*Note: This example uses jQuery, but the same could be achieved with vanilla JavaScript.*

**HTML**
```html
<!-- add jQuery CDN - current version 3.3.1 -->
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js"></script>
```

**JS**
```js
let results = L.layerGroup().addTo(map);
searchControl.on("results", function (data) {
    results.clearLayers();
    for (let i = data.results.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        results.addLayer(L.marker(data.results[i].latlng)
        .bindPopup(data.results[0].text)
        .bindTooltip(data.results[0].text));

        // code by: Tim Nelson (https://github.com/TravelTimN)
        $(".geocoder-control-input").on("click", function () {
            currentZoom = map.getZoom();
            if (currentZoom > 7) {
                newZoom = 7;
                currentBounds = map.getBounds();
                centLat = (Math.floor(currentBounds._northEast.lat)
                + Math.floor(currentBounds._southWest.lat)) / 2;
                centLng = (Math.floor(currentBounds._northEast.lng)
                + Math.floor(currentBounds._southWest.lng)) / 2;
                map.flyTo([centLat, centLng], newZoom);
            }
        });
    }
});
```

Once the user clicks on the Esri Geocoder Search button, it will capture the current mapBounds. Using the bounds of the current latitude and longitude, depending on the current zoom-level, it will automatically zoom out far enough the the Geocoder Search function to search globally again. Should the user already be zoomed-out to a high enough level, nothing will happen.

Now you can search for small-town middle-of-nowhere, followed by large metropolis without any problems! **(P.S. - You're Welcome!)**

**ADDITIONAL PLUGINS**

If you have a dataset with a large amount of Markers, you may want to consider using some additional plugins, such as the **[Leaflet.markercluster](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster)** plugin. This will group markers that are nearby to each other, until the user zooms-in further, at which point the map will *spiderfy* and ungroup the markers bit-by-bit.

In conjunction with the *Leaflet.markercluster* plugin, another plugin that works well with it is the **[Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport](https://github.com/ghybs/Leaflet.MarkerCluster.LayerSupport)** plugin. It helps to group different layers or markers which can be filtered.

If you'd like to see both of these plugins in action, I used both of them on my **[Code Institute Milestone #2 project](https://traveltimn.github.io/ci-milestone02-ifd/)**. This was due to the fact that I have over 11,000 markers in my dataset of various types!

There are hundreds of possibilities that you can incorporate into your LeafletJS map project.

##

### **LeafletJS vs Google Maps**

Although LeafletJS is a free open-source library, it doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that Google Maps offers "out of the box". Depending on what your goal is for a map project, you may require plugins to build the map. In some cases, a paid API Key would be required, similar to the method which Google Maps introduced in the summer of 2018. Some examples of why you would need an API Key:

- *Search nearby* to display the closest hotels / restaurants / ATMs / etc.
- Custom map tiles that may not be free.
- Providing *direction*s from point-to-point.
- Access to *Street View*.

If you're building a **Holiday Destination Finder** for the Milestone project, don't be discouraged that LealetJS can't perform the *search nearby* function. There are alternate API Key providers that are cheaper than Google, which can be implemented quick and simple into a Leaflet map! You just need to look around online - I've left plenty of sources above as starting points!

There are several functions that Google provides with the use of the API Key, which Leaflet would require additional plugings to accomplish. Some quick *pros* and *cons*, purely based on my own experience with each.

| **LeafletJS** *(pros)* | **Google Maps** *(pros)* | **LeafletJS** *(cons)* | **Google Maps** *(cons)* |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Free / Open-Source | Several built-in Features | Requires plugins for advanced features | No longer free (25k hits/day) |
| Dozens of plugins | Sharable Directions | Not as well-known (yet) | Bulky loads / callbacks |
| Lightweight | Search nearest POI | | Invalid code can cause excess callbacks, eating into free credits |
| Completely customizable | Very well-known | | Closed Source |
| Excellent documentation | Excellent documentation | | Discourages interaction with non-Google products |
| Easy to use | Simple(ish) enough to use | | Difficult to migrate to another service |
| Dozens of free map tile providers | | | Single basemap tiles only |

Everyone has their own opinions, and may find something easier than others. Whether it's **LeafletJS**, **Google Maps**, or one of the several other map APIs that exist, the important thing is that you learn something new, and have fun building your maps!!
